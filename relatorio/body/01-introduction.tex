\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This document consists of the report for the practical assignment of the course entitled \emph{Fundamentos de Sistemas Distribu√≠dos}, part of the Integrated Master's Degree in Informatics Engineering at the University of Minho, lectured in the 2019/2020 school year.
With this assignment, students were prompted to develop a Twitter-like distributed messaging system with global ordering guarantees and persistence.

This report is organized as follows. We begin in Section~\ref{sec:problem} by describing the system's requirements.
Section~\ref{sec:design} then details the architecture of the developed system and justifies its major design decisions. Section~\ref{sec:implementation} describes several aspects of the system's implementation, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the report.
